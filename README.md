# progconc_primes
Parallel program to count prime numbers in a sequence  

**How to use**  

Run the gerarNumeros.sh to create 5 lists with a 100, 1000, 10000, 100000 and 1000000 numbers in different files.  
Then run play.sh to run the codes to identify the prime numbers in the sequences using different numbers of threads.  
After that, you'll have two csvs with time measures gotten from the execution.  
The file MÃ©tricas.xlsx is one of the scenarios I found running the scripts and it's still necessary to edit the sheets by hand to generate other graphics (can be automated using languages like python).
